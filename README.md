# Instagram Scraper Program

## Overview

This project is an Instagram Scraper application built with a **Python Flask** backend and **Vue.js 3** frontend. The application allows users to scrape Instagram data such as user profiles, posts, and stories. It stores the scraped data in a MySQL database and provides an API to interact with the data.

## Features
